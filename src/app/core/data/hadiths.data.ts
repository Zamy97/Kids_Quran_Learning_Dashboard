    text: 'The Prophet ﷺ said: "The strong person is not the one who can wrestle others down. The strong person is the one who controls himself when he is angry."',
    reference: 'Sahih Bukhari & Muslim',
    story: 'One day, a man came to the Prophet ﷺ and asked him for advice. The Prophet ﷺ told him, "Do not get angry." The man asked again and again, and each time the Prophet ﷺ said the same thing: "Do not get angry." This shows how important it is to control our anger. Even when we feel upset, we should try to stay calm and not hurt others with our words or actions.',
    lesson: 'Real strength is not about fighting or being tough. Real strength is being able to control yourself when you\'re angry or upset. When someone makes you angry, try to take deep breaths, count to 10, or walk away. This makes you a truly strong person in the eyes of Allah!'
