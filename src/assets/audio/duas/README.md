# Dua audio (human recitations)

The app uses **text-to-speech** for duas by default. To hear **human recitations** instead, add MP3 files here.

## File names

Name each file exactly as the dua **id** + `.mp3`. The app will load them automatically.

## Where to get MP3s

- **Apps:** “Daily Duas”, “Fortress of the Muslim”, or similar apps often let you play or export audio.
- **Web:** Search for “daily duas MP3” or “Islamic supplications audio” and download by occasion (e.g. “dua before eating Arabic”).
- **YouTube:** Search “daily duas with audio” or the Arabic text; use a legal downloader/converter if you have permission.
- **Record:** Ask a reciter or family member to record each dua; name the file as in the table above.

After adding files, rebuild or refresh the app. The player will use the MP3 when the file exists; otherwise it falls back to the built-in read-aloud (TTS).
